## Arsenio Draco | Frontend Developer Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, a fully self-built online presentation of my skills, projects, and professional identity as a frontend developer. The site serves as a central hub to showcase who I am, what I have accomplished, and the range of technical and logical abilities I bring to web development. It is designed not only as a visual statement but also as a professional artifact that reflects my approach to problem-solving, design, and interactive experiences. The website emphasizes clarity, professionalism, and readability while highlighting my personal style and technical mindset. Every section, every interaction, and every design decision was made with the goal of accurately representing my skills and approach to development in a tangible, easily accessible format.

## About Me

I am a frontend developer with a passion for creating elegant, responsive, and highly functional web experiences. My focus extends beyond visual design into the logical and computational foundations of user interfaces. I enjoy transforming complex concepts into intuitive, interactive, and accessible web solutions.

This portfolio represents more than just my work—it is a reflection of my professional identity, showcasing my dedication to clean, maintainable code, thoughtful design decisions, and a strong logic-first approach to frontend development. Through this website, I aim to communicate not only what I have built but also how I think about building, structuring, and refining web experiences.

## Note on the Name
While my legal name is Arseniy Voynov, I use Arsenio Draco professionally and online. It’s a name I’ve been using for years and serves as my personal brand for projects, portfolios, and public profiles.

## Featured Projects

This section highlights several projects that exemplify my technical and creative abilities. Each project was chosen to demonstrate both the depth of my logical problem-solving skills and my proficiency in crafting interactive, engaging experiences.

### Moon Location Tracker

A browser-based lunar position calculator designed for accuracy and efficiency. Using mathematical models and analytical methods, this tool calculates the Moon’s real-time longitude, latitude, and distance. It demonstrates my ability to combine logic, computation, and frontend presentation in a way that produces highly usable and precise results.

### Chromapedia

An interactive web tool for browsing and experimenting with color palettes. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Chromapedia demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, user interaction design, and responsive layout principles. It reflects my attention to both aesthetic detail and functional usability.

### Math Problem Generator

A browser-based application that creates fully randomized math exercises across multiple domains. The project emphasizes logical structuring, reproducibility, and educational utility. It illustrates my ability to write code that balances complexity with usability, providing meaningful outcomes without sacrificing clarity.

### WeatherTracker

A minimalist weather dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. WeatherTracker is designed to display current weather conditions and short-term forecasts in a clear, intuitive interface. This project showcases my attention to responsive design, graceful data handling, and user-centric presentation.

### Cooking Recipe Generator

A dynamic recipe generator built to produce logical, reproducible culinary combinations from a database of ingredients, cooking methods, and cuisines. This project highlights my ability to structure complex data into coherent, accessible interfaces while maintaining flexibility and creativity.

### Childlike Doodle Generator

A creative, interactive tool that produces randomized childlike drawings using controlled algorithmic techniques. This project demonstrates my interest in combining logic, graphics, and playful experimentation to create engaging and visually distinctive experiences.

## Skills and Expertise

This portfolio also serves as a record of my core professional skills and competencies, which I bring to every project and collaboration:

1) Frontend Development: Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with experience building fully functional, responsive web pages and interfaces.

2) UI/UX Design: Skilled at crafting clean, intuitive, and user-friendly designs that prioritize readability, hierarchy, and engagement.

3) Logical Problem-Solving: Strong emphasis on mathematical and logical thinking in both interface behavior and algorithmic design.

4) Responsive and Accessible Design: Commitment to building experiences that function seamlessly across devices while maintaining accessibility and usability standards.

5) Project Planning and Execution: Experienced in managing end-to-end project workflows, from initial concept and design to implementation and refinement.

These skills reflect my broader approach to development: every project is not only about aesthetics but also about clarity, precision, and logical cohesion.

## Technical Details

The portfolio website itself is built using fundamental web technologies:

1) HTML: Semantic and accessible markup forms the foundation of the site.

2) CSS: Custom styling ensures a polished, professional aesthetic, responsive layout, and visual consistency.

3) JavaScript: A small enhancement using Typed.js creates dynamic text animations in the hero section, adding personality and interactive flair.

4) Typography and Visual Design: The site uses Montserrat for headings and Roboto for body text to ensure readability and a cohesive visual identity.

While the site’s purpose is to present me and my work, the technical execution reflects careful attention to modern frontend principles: simplicity, performance, and maintainability.

## Personal Note

This website is the culmination of careful planning, deliberate design choices, and a commitment to professional presentation. Every section, interaction, and project description was created with the goal of accurately reflecting my identity as a frontend developer. I have been making and posting projects on Github for several months now, which is why I thought that making this portfolio would be the next natural step to showcase my skills. It demonstrates my ability to think logically, structure content effectively, and communicate technical ideas through both design and code. This portfolio is not just a site — it is a professional narrative, crafted to showcase my experience, skills, and approach to development in a tangible, readable, and impactful way.
